# Blackjack
Blackjack is a well known card game also known as Twenty-One. The player is dealt two cards from a randomly shuffled, 52-card deck. The dealer is also dealt two cards from the deck with one card faced downwards. The player can then choose to either hit or stay. If the player hits, they are dealt another card. If the player stays, the dealer will then hit or stay. The dealer will hit until the total is 17 or greater. If either the dealer or player go over 21, they lose. If the player wins, the player receives the bet. If the player loses, the player loses the bet. If the first two cards drawn add to 21, the player wins.
